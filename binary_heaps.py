# heapify an element - percolate up

# heapify an element - percolate down

# insert element in MinHeap

# insert an element in MaxHeap

# delete an arbitrary element from MinHeap

# delete an ith indexed element from MinHeap

# get maximum element in MinHeap

# get minimum element in MinHeap

# heap sort

# find all elements less than k in binary heap

# merge 2 binary maxHeaps , size of first heap = m+n size of second heap = n , complexity O(m+n.log(m+n))

# merge 2 binary maxHeaps , size of first heap = m+n size of second heap = n , complexity O(m+n)

# get kth smallest element in MinHeap, complexity O(klogn)

# get kth smallest element in MinHeap, complexity O(n)

# get k max elements from maxHeap

# implement stack using heap

# implement queue using heap

# given a big file with million of numbers, how do you find 10 maximum numbers from that file

# merge k sorted lists with total n inputs altogether time complexity O(nk), space complexity O(1)

# merge k sorted lists with total n inputs altogether time complexity O(nlogk), space complexity O(k) - using heaps

# given 2 arrays A and B each with n elements, find largest n pairs (A[i],B[j])

# min-max heap - structure that supports min and max in O(1) time, insert, deletemin, deletemax in O(logn) time

# design heap data structure that supports finding the median in an infinite series of integers

# maximum number in sliding window - brute force

# maximum number in sliding winodw - using heap data structure

# maximum number in sliding window - using double-ended-queue (perfect data structure for this problem)

# merge(union) two binary heaps

# find minimum window in inputString which will contain all chars in Pattern in complexity O(n).
# if no such window, return empty string. If multiple such windows, return one unique minimum window

# in maxHeap, check if kth largest item is >= x, runtime O(k)

# Given k lists of sorted integers, find smallest range that includes atleast one number from each of k lists
