# 3 types of edits can be performed on strings: insert a char, remove a char, replace a  char.
# given 2 strings, write a program to check if they are one edit (or zero edit) away.
# example:
# pale, ple -> true
# pales, pale -> true
# pale, bale -> true
# pale, bae -> false

# given an image represented by N X N matrix, where each pixel in the image is 4 bytes. write a program to rotate the
# image by 90 degrees. Do it in place.

# write a program such that if an element in an M X N matrix is 0, its entire row and column are set to 0.

# write a program to sort stack such that the smallest items are on top.You can use an additional temporary stack, but
# you may not copy the elements to any other data structure, like an array. Stack supports push, pop, peek, isEmpty.

# A binary search tree was created by traversing through an array from left to right and inserting each element.
# Given a bst with distinct elements, print all possible arrays that could have led to this tree.
# example: input :  2
#                 /   \
#                1     3
# output: {2, 1, 3}, {2, 3, 1}.

# You are implementing a bst class from scratch, which ga methods insert, find, delete, getRandomNode() which returns
# a random node from the tree. All nodes should be equally likely to be chosen. desing getRandomNode() and other methods

# we need to start from upper left corner of grid with r rows and c columns.We can only move right and down but certain
# cells are 'off-limit' such that we can not step on them. Write an algorithm to find a path from top left to bottom
# right.

# A magic index in an array A[1, ..., n-1] is defined to be an index such that A[i] = i. Given a sorted array of
# distinct integers, write a program to find a magic index, if one exists.

# given a sorted array of n integers that has been rotated an unknown number of times, write a program to find an
# element in the array.You may assum the original array to be sorted in increasing order.

# given a M X N matrix with each row and column sorted in ascending order. write a program to find an element.

# In an array of integers, a peak is an element which is greater than or equal to the adjacent integers and a valley
# is an element which is less than or equal to the adjacent integers. given an array, sort the array into an
# alternating sequence of peaks and valleys.
# example: input: {5,3,1,2,3} , output: {5,1,3,2,3}.
