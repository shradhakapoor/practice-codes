# Box Stacking: given a set of n rectangular 3D boxes. Dimensions of ith box are height hi, widhth wi, depth di.
# Create a stack of boxes as tall as possible, but only stack a box on another box if dimensions of 2D base of lower box
# are each strictly larger than those of 2D base of higher box. We can rotate a box so that any side functions as its
# base.It is possible to use multiple instances of same type of box.
