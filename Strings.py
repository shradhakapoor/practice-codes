# Implement Trie to insert, search, delete a string

# Implement Ternary Search Tree to insert, search, delete a string, Displaying all words of Tree

# Implement Suffix Tree to insert, search, delete a string

# Given a paragraph of words, find the word which appears maximum times. (use heap amd tries combination)

# Given 2 strings, find the longest common substring, using suffix tree, time O(m+n)

# Given text T, find the substring of T which is longest palindrome, using suffix tree

# Reverse a string, time O(n), space O(n)

# Reverse a string without using any temporary variable, time O(n), space O(1)

# give an algorithm for matching pattern in text. Assume ? and * are wildcard chars.Brute Force. time O(mn) space O(1)

# Reverse words in a sentence. time O(mn) space O(1)

# Print all permutations of a string(anagrams)

# Print all combinations of a string

# Given a string 'ABCCBCBA', recursively remove adjacent characters if they are same.
# for example, ABCCBCBA->ABBCBA->ACBA

# Given a set of characters C and input string I, find minimum window in I that contains all chars in C.
# example: I = ABBACBAA, C = AAB has minimum window BAA

# Given 2 strings s1, s2. print all interleavings of s1, s2. Assume all chars in s1, s2 are different

# Given a matrix nXn containing random numbers. Check whether the rows match with columns. use suffix tree.

# Replace all spaces with '%20'. Assume string has sufficient space at end of string to hold additional characters.

# Given a 2D board containing 'X' and 'O', capture all regions surrounded by 'X'. A region is captured by flipping all
# 'O's into 'X's in that surrounded region.
